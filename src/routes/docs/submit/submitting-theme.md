# Submitting Your Theme

So you're ready to submit your theme. Here are your options:

### Pull Request

Clone [the repo](https://github.com/Gibbu/BDThemeEditor) and make a pull request with the following:

- Your theme config added to `src/data/themes`.
- Your theme config imported to `src/data/themes/index.ts`.
- Your developer file added to `src/data/devs`.

### Send your config files to me.

If you cannot be bothered with all that, you can just send me your theme config files and I'll all that for you (minus the pull requesting).
